<h1>Catanduanes </h1>
<p align="center">Catanduanes is our home province, it is an island that contains a lot of resorts tourists spots and even good food restaurants<br>
It really has enjoying trip to go into but the only problem is that it is far away from the city, if you travel by plane, it will just take you 1hr and 30 mins <br>
but if you travel by private vehicle or even a bus, it will take you one day, and included as well when crossing the sea to arrive at the island.<br>
We have fun in there because we had a lot of relatives that can assist us where we wanted to go, But if you're a just a traveler who wants to visit<br> 
I recommend having a tourguide and having a reservation to have a planned trip. They had also pure white beaches in there like the twin rock beach resort<br>
so that you can enjoy it as much as you visit boracay. <p/>

<h2>Tanay.Rizal </h2>
<p align="center">Tanay in the past years ago, it just a pure province who's just quiet,calm and relaxing to go,nowadays, well it just the same but <br>
it has a lot of tourists especially motor riders who's in a group together to have chill ride, I think it is because of pandemic that people forced <br>
to go anywhere because they are already bored at home, and even business-mind people in there really take advantage of it, they construct restaurants, <br>
good viewing landscape,resorts,falls and even more,it's just like Baguio because it is really cold in there and have relaxing wind that passes through your nose.<br>
It just takes 1hr to visit tanay so what are you waiting for? reserve and visit now! <p/>

<h3>Sea Breeze Resort </h3>
<p align="center">Seabreeze resort is already a tourist spot even before pandemic, and because of their near-affordable resort here in city, <br>
they renovate the resort to accomodate more people and guess what?, they build wavepools,private pools, fun pool rides and more!, <br>
they now have better facilities to cope more tourists as the time passed.It just located here in Taguig, and when you go there, <br>
the most common tourists are the family reunions, school batch/classmates and more. So visit now whyle there are still few people.<p/>

<p align="center">Enchanted Kingdom is a really popular tourist spot here in the Philippines,It is an amusement park that people already know about <br>
It has exciting fun rides that you cannot say no to it because it is really fun!, I'm browsing Tiktok and they say that visit now because they still have few visitors <Br>
It will take you all to fun rides,you can take all rides without thinking the queue every ride, So what are you waiting for? Ride and Enjoy now! <p/>
